## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r load-data}
# Load spatial data
world_sf <- st_read("World_Countries_(Generalized)_9029012925078512962.geojson")

# Load gender inequality data
gender_inequality<-read.csv("global_gender_indequality_index-data.csv")
```
